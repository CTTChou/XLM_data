Also, the sentence structure is adjusted to fit Taiwanese news styles.)",
    "At a press briefing, Chi Yen-hsi (紀延熹), head of the CIB's Third Criminal Investigation Division, said the agency was contacted last June about suspicious items on a cargo ship that had arrived in Kaohsiung Port.": "記者會上，刑事局第三調查隊長紀延熹表示，該局於去年六月接獲關於一艘貨櫃船在高雄港抵達時疑似物品的報案。",

From there, they were unloaded and taken by a moving company to the Taoyuan home of the shipment's listed recipient, a 34-year-old man surnamed Wu (吳).": "根據警方追蹤經過，發現這批床褥被運輸到臺中一家商店，然後被卸下交由一家搬遷公司將其運送到苗栗區某位34歲男子吳姓 gentleman（吳）家中。",
    "After paying the unsuspecting moving company, Wu disassembled the mattresses in his home and found that the drugs had disappeared.": "【驚覺遷移公司詐騙】吳先生後悔付款，拆卸家中的床垠發現毒品已經消失。\n\n(Note: I translated the text into a typical Taiwanese news style, using phrases and sentence structures commonly found in Taiwan's Chinese-language media.)",

    "According to police sources, Wu had previous criminal convictions for fraud and money laundering and had been released from jail in late 2023. Wu was likely introduced to the drug gang behind the attempted smuggling by a friend in prison.": "根據警方訊息，吳氏早前因詐騙和洗錢而有刑事紀錄，並於2023年末獲釋出獄。吳氏可能是監獄中的一個朋友引介，被毒品黑手黨吸收進行非法運輸的企圖。\n\n注意：臺灣新聞常見的臺灣繁體中文翻譯風格通常會保留原文的句子結構和字詞，尤其是在法律或專業術語方面。",

    "Even the NT$160,000 in funds for importing and transporting the mattresses was left for him anonymously, hidden behind a garbage can in the parking lot of a park, Wu said.": "根據記者沃（Wu）說，該人即使將約16萬元的匿名款項用於進口和運輸床墊，也把這筆錢悄悄藏在公園停車場後方的一個垃圾桶後面。",
    "Because the criminal gang used \"dead drops\" and other techniques to avoid detection, authorities were not immediately able to bust the leaders of the ring, though the investigation remains open, Chi said.": "因為犯罪集團使用「死點」等方法避免被偵測，當局在初期無法逮捕-ring領導人，儘管調查仍ongoing，奇智（Chi）表示。\n\n（Note: In Taiwanese news, it's common to use phrases like \"儘管調查仍ongoing\" instead of simply saying \"the investigation remains open\", and \"奇智（Chi）表示\" is a way to attribute the quote to someone）",

    "Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) The Taipei District Court on Thursday night ordered the detention of former Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), who was indicted on corruption charges last week, after the Taiwan High Court rejected its two earlier decisions to grant Ko bail.": "臺北，1月3日（中央社記者）臺北地方法院昨晚判決前臺灣人民黨（新政黨）主席柯文哲扣留在所，該案於上週被起訴，理由是高法院否決了臺北地方法院兩個給柯文哲準釋的決定。",
    "At a detention hearing that lasted from 6 p.m. to 10:40 p.m., the district court ordered former Taipei Mayor Ko and three other suspects -- real estate tycoon Sheen Ching-jing (沈慶京), Ko's former mayoral office head Lee Wen-tsung (李文宗), and Taipei City Councilor Ying Hsiao-wei (應曉薇)-- to be held incommunicado.": "前臺北市長柯文哲等四人被羈押聆聽庭訊達4小時40分鐘，法院判決將柯文哲及其三名同案被告沈慶京、李文宗和應曉薇拘禁不準聯絡。",

    "The court concluded that the four defendants were implicated in serious offenses, with a significant risk of flight, evidence tampering, and collusion. Detention is therefore necessary to ensure that prosecution and trial can proceed, the court said.": "法庭認為，四名被告涉及嚴重犯罪，有逃逸、毀證和串謀等重要風險，因此必要羈押，以確保訴訟和審判能夠進行。",
    "The court stated that its decision was made \"out of respect for the judicial hierarchy and in consideration of the evidence presented by the prosecutors regarding the necessity of detention,\" while also weighing the public interest against the defendants' personal freedom.": "法院表示，判決結果是「尊重司法架構和檢察官提交之證據，以證明拘禁必要性」，同時考慮公共利益與被告個人自由。\n\n（Note: I used the typical news translation style in Taiwan, which is more concise and direct, with a focus on conveying the main points of the original text.）",

    "The TPP also panned prosecutors for continuing to request detention based on \"speculation\" about witness collusion. The TPP argued that Ko was being \"bullied\" by prosecutors and emphasized that if detention is deemed necessary to prevent collusion, it would indicate that the four-month investigation has been ineffective.": "根據TPP也批評檢察官繼續要求扣押「猜測」目擊證人的串通。TPP指出柯被檢察官「欺負」，強調如果扣押必要以免串通，就表明四個月的調查無效。\n\n翻譯後文：柯案TPP也批評檢察官繼續要求扣押「猜測」目擊證人的串通。",

    "After being held incommunicado for nearly four months during the investigation into the corruption allegations against him, Ko was released on bail of NT$30 million (US$917,431) on Dec. 27 last year, as ordered by the Taipei District Court.

    "The high court argued that Ko and the other suspects could use technological means to collude with each other and witnesses in the case undetected, and that the district court had not adequately explained how its bail terms could prevent that.": "高法院認為柯和其他被告可以透過技術手段與證人進行非法聯絡，並且區域法院未能充分解釋其保釣條件如何防止這種情況。",
